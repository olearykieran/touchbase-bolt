# Payment Integration Progress Log

## Step 1: Backend Quota Enforcement
- [x] Implemented backend logic to enforce 3 free AI messages/week and 3 free contacts/week per user.
- [x] Quotas reset weekly. Subscription status checked via Stripe and stored in Supabase `profiles`.

## Step 2: Stripe Webhook Integration
- [x] Stripe webhook endpoint created for `invoice.payment_succeeded` and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.
- [x] Webhook secret added to environment variables.

## Step 3: Frontend Store & API
- [x] Updated `addContact` in store to use Edge Function (`add-contact`) for quota enforcement.
- [x] PaymentRequiredError (402) handled in UI.

## Step 4: Paywall Modal Implementation
- [x] Created `PaywallModal` component to prompt users to upgrade when exceeding limits.
- [x] Modal offers $2.99/month and $12.99/year options.

## Step 5: Paywall Modal Integration
- [x] Integrated `PaywallModal` into Add Contact and Contacts List screens.
- [x] Modal is shown when a payment/limit error is detected (messages or contacts).

## Step 6: Testing & Next Steps
- [ ] Test the entire flow for adding contacts and generating messages to ensure proper enforcement and modal display.
- [x] Integrate Stripe payment links or checkout flow into modal `onUpgrade` actions.
- [ ] Refine UI/UX based on feedback and edge cases.

**Current Status:**
- Paywall modal shows correctly on contact limit error and upgrade buttons open Stripe payment links.
- Next, test the message quota limit and refine UI/UX.
