## Troubleshooting

### "Link expired" error
- This happens when email providers scan the link
- Solution: Request a new password reset and click the link immediately

### Can't see password reset form
- Make sure you clicked the email link first
- The link creates a session in your browser
- Return to the app after clicking the link

### Still having issues?
The password reset uses a web-based flow for security. This means:
1. Email link → Opens in browser → Creates session
2. Return to app → App detects session → Shows password form

## Alternative Solution
If password reset continues to fail:
1. Contact support to manually reset your password
2. Create a new account with a different email
3. Try using a different email provider
