# Quick Fixes Applied

## TypeScript Errors Fixed:
1. ✅ Replaced react-native-haptic-feedback with expo-haptics
2. ✅ Fixed contact picker type issues (undefined id handling)
3. ✅ Fixed notification content structure
4. ⚠️ Notification triggers have compatibility issues with current expo-notifications types

## Known Issues:
- Daily notification triggers are not properly typed in expo-notifications
- Supabase edge functions have Deno-specific imports (won't affect app build)

## Workaround for Testing:
The app will work fine for testing all features except scheduled daily notifications. You can still test:
- Immediate notifications
- Time-based notifications (with seconds)
- All other app features

## Before Final Build:
Consider updating expo-notifications or using a different notification scheduling approach.
